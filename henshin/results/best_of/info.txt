Here we placed our best results for each input model.
They are results from the following runs:

inputRDG_A: nearly all runs, e.g. all crossover test runs.
inputRDG_B: nearly all runs, e.g. all crossover test runs.
inputRDG_C: test run for initilization with 20 iterations and all "features in one class" initilization. ()
inputRDG_D: test run for initilization with 20 iterations and "mixed" initilization.
inputRDG_E: test run for initilization with 20 iterations and "mixed" initilization.
